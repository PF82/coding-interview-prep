TAKE HOME PROJECTS

Programming interviews have always been stressful. Job applicants are sometimes given a take home project to be completed outside of the interview. These types of interviews usually require a lot of work, but they're a great way for employers to see how you might perform on the job.

Build the bonus coding projects below for extra practice. Take your time, make them great, and put them on your resume or portfolio to show potential employers.

SHOW THE LOCAL WEATHER

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Note: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/ which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to CodePen.io via https://.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the freeCodeCamp forum.
